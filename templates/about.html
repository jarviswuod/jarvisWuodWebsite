        "The Bad Guys" is my all-time favorite movie. Arsenal fan, I'm an Andrew
        Tate, Alex Harmozi and Dan Koe fan. I have never travelled outisde my
        country. Hunger is my kryptonite, Freezing temperatures are my
        arch-nemesis, black and white are my favorite colors. I enjoy all music
        genres, but very choosy.

      <p>
        The first time I saw laptop in real life was in back in 2013 when I was
        well. This was from my cousin who was in campus by then. Well this is
        what's it means to be born in Africa. Other than this, I was fortune
        enough to see it in movies. Ever since I always wanted to own a laptop
        and just use it. I didn't by then any carrer I was to do . All I wanted
        was just to grow up namand have a job that requires me to use) own a
        laptop.
      </p>
      <p>
        First forward, making my application to college I knew what it means to
        own a laptop and what should be done with it. I chose IT profession
        mainly it wasvbecaise it was an inspiration from my brother, else if my
        English was good, I could actually be doing some video production staff.
        To be honest I still feel like just doin it for fun. Yes I'm still
        limited but won't be for long after I officially start vlogging my
        life's journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        In campus, my main laptop thing was downloading and watching movies, and
        not anything else, this was after I made fully committing to studies in
        my year exams and never felt like the energy was in vein first exams
        and. It was only until me going for internship that I realized I was
        growing old from campus, almost graduating but no still to attest myslf
        with. This was back in 2022 when I officially began to learn to code of
        course with challenges, progress and growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        3 years later , I got have a full-time job in tech as a software
        developer in a startup, one that requires me to use a laptop like all
        the time. Building a personal brand to help developers learn quick than
        I did or land a job faster. With plans to build 2 online products to
        stream in generation wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dreams you ask, want to 10x my current pay working remotely, build 2
        online products that help make people's lives better, and have fun while
        doing it, achieve financial freedom . I. Not doing this for me, in doing
        it for me, my kids, my mom, my dad and siblings and just everyone I care
        about. I want to make it so big that nobody I care about ever thinks of
        work again to survive but to multiple what's there already. Funky thing
        I crazy to think it's possible and what's even crazier I don't anyone
        can change my mind on that dream.
