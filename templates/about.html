        The first time I saw a laptop in real life was back in 2013 when I was
        around 12. Before that, I was only fortunate enough to see it in movies.
        Well, that's what it means to be born as me in Africa. The great fortune
        came from my cousin, who was in college at the time. That’s where this
        whole tech thing began for me because, ever since then, I’ve always
        wanted to own a laptop, just to use it, without needing to know what
        career I’d pursue or what it takes to own one. All I wanted was to grow
        up and have a job that required using a laptop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward to after high school, I still had that dream of owning a
        laptop, it just looked so cool to me. Childish, right? Wait, when
        applying to college, I knew which career paths relied heavily on laptops
        and what it meant to actually own one. That’s why I chose IT out of all
        the careers, reason? It's had been my childhood inspiration and advice
        from my brother. Honestly, I would have chosen video production given my
        good English grade unfortunately, it wasn’t good enough. To this day, a
        part of me still wants to do some video editing just for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still remember that in college, my main laptop agenda was downloading
        and watching movies over the college Wi-Fi, nothing else. I know, "you
        lazy brat", you'd call me. Don’t get me wrong, I made that choice after
        fully committing to studies during my first exams. But exams being what
        they are, I didn’t perform in line with the effort I put in, so could
        have guessed, I said, f*** it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t until I applied for my internship that I realized I was
        growing up, almost graduating, but had no skills to show. And yes, my
        grades weren’t much either. This was back in 2022, when I officially
        began to learn how to code (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) during my internship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three years later, I’ve landed a full-time job as a software developer
        at a tech startup. And yes, it’s one that requires me to use a laptop
        all the time. Beyond that, I’m building my personal brand to help
        developers learn faster than I did and land jobs more quickly. I also
        plan to build two online products to create generational wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dreams? You ask. I want to 10x my current pay working remotely, build
        those two products that make people’s lives better, achieve financial
        freedom, and have fun while doing it. Honestly, I just want to make it
        so big that everyone I care about my mom, dad, and siblings never thinks
        of work as a means of survival but as a way to multiply what’s already
        there. I know, it sounds crazy to believe it's possible, but wait,
        what’s even crazier is that I don’t want anyone, not even myself, to
        change my mind about this dream.
